# SSBL

Simple Stack Based Language (SSBL) is a silly interpreter project I made based on a Python tutorial, but remade it in C.
The tutorial the project is based on is [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A3gTw1ZkeK0)

# SBFM

Simple Binary File Maker is the thing that makes binary files out of source files.
Not exactly a compiler, though, since it does not write machine code, but rather just binary data that `ssbl` can read.


# How to build
Just run `[Any shell you want] make.sh` (GNU/Linux) or just run `make.bat` (MS Windows).


# How to use

Write a script with a .ssbl extension. Use `sbfm` to create a binary file that actually uses


# File extensions

## .ssbl
  Source code file.
  Not required for code to be compiled, but it's better to differentiate between plaintext and source.

## .sbff
  Binary generated by `sbfm` (Simple Binary File Maker)
  Not an executable. Can't be run by `./program.sbff`, run with `ssbl ./program.sbff` instead.
