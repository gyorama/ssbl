Simple Stack Based Language (SSBL) is a silly interpreter project I made based on a Python tutorial, but remade it in C.

Note: This is a remake of the project. The original was so ass I wanted it to stop existing.


# File extensions

## .ssbl
  Source code file.
  Not required for code to be compiled, but it's better to differentiate between plaintext and source.

## .sbff
  Binary generated by `sbfm` (Simple Binary File Maker)
  Can be under .bin or any other file extension, but it's better to differentiate between other files and files runable with `ssbl`
